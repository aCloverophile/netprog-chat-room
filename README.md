# chatroom application w/ end-to-end encryption
---

💛 **As the semester project for the "Network Programming" course, I created a chatroom application written in Python.**

The project aimed to sharpen our skills in working with asynchronous programming, understanding the sockets concept, analyzing example network flow between two parties and experiencing the usage of public key cryptography in chat applications.

## Technology Stack
- It is a CLI application.
- The backend was written in Python.
- PostgreSQL was used for the database.

Note: the application itself was developed and intended for the semester project. So it is normal that it may have some bugs, vulnerabilities and logic flaws in asynchronous programming implementation. The main goal was learning. 

Special thanks to Orkhan Mehbaliyev for the testing stage of the application. He took the risk and sacrificed his computer for this project testing! 😁
